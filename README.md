# Go-Linker

> **tl;dr**\
> It's a fancy bookmark extension.

A lightweight Chrome extension that lets you create and manage local URL shortlinks directly in your browser.  
Type commands like `go me` in the address bar to quickly navigate to your saved URLs, organized by user-defined groups.


This project is based on the Go links at Google because it's just super convenient to have!
This [repo](https://github.com/kellegous/go) is also a big inspiration, but I simply just want to have short links
just for my self, especially since my bookmarks are full.
